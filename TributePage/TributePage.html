                >“Atatürk reminds us of the historical achievements of one of
                the great men of this century, his inspiring leadership of the
                Turkish people, his far-sighted understanding of the modern
                world, and his power and high courage as a military leader. The
                birth of a free Turkey from a collapsed empire, the honorable
                declaration of the freedom and independence of the new Turkey,
                and the preservation of it ever since, are the work of Ataturk's
                Turkish people. Undoubtedly, there is no example that
                demonstrates the trust of a mass in him more successfully than
                the deep and broad reforms he initiated in Turkey.”</i
